  Extract personal facts from this conversation on {dateString}.

  EXISTING GENERAL MEMORIES TO CHECK FOR UPDATES:
  {existingContext.generalMemories}

  CONVERSATION:
  {conversationContext}

  TASK: Extract important, stable personal facts about the user. ONLY EXTRACT CONCRETE INFORMATION THE USER HAS EXPLICITY CONFIRMED.

  MEMORY EXTRACTION RULES:
  1. Put ALL memory mentions in the generalMemories array (whether new or existing)
  2. IF referencing an EXISTING memory: Include the ID from the existing memories list above
  3. IF discovering a NEW memory: Leave out the ID field entirely
  4. IF new information REFINES/UPDATES existing memory: Update the existing memory with ID
  5. IF new information is COMPLETELY DIFFERENT topic: Create new memory without ID
  6. Any information about plans/considerations/aspirations/goals/wants/ should not be extracted as memories.

  MEMORY UPDATE EXAMPLES:

  ✅ UPDATING EXISTING MEMORY (Adding Detail):
  Existing: ID: 2025-01-15memory3 | "User works as an engineer" (occupation)
  Input: "I'm a senior software engineer at Google"
  Extract:
  - id: "2025-01-15memory3", 
  - content: "User is a senior software engineer at Google", 
  - tag: "occupation"
  Reason: This adds detail to the existing occupation

  ✅ CREATING NEW MEMORY (Different Aspect):
  Existing: ID: 2025-01-15memory4 | "User has brown hair" (hair_color)
  Input: "I have blue eyes"
  Extract:
  - content: "User has blue eyes", 
  - tag: "eye_color"
  Reason: Eye color is different from hair color, both should exist

  ✅ COMBINING RELATED ASPECTS OF SAME TRAIT:
  Existing: ID: 2025-01-15memory5 | "User has an analytical mindset" (skill)
  Input: "I've always worked best by analytically breaking down problems. That's how my mind works and it's what my talent is"
  Extract:
  - id: "2025-01-15memory5",
  - content: "User has an analytical mindset and talent for breaking down problems", 
  - tag: "skill"
  Reason: Both statements describe the same core skill - analytical thinking

  ATOMIC MEMORY PRINCIPLE: Extract specific, atomic personal facts - ONE FACT PER MEMORY with ONE TAG. Combine related aspects of the SAME characteristic, separate truly DIFFERENT characteristics.

  EXAMPLES OF WHAT TO EXTRACT:

  ✅ PERSONAL IDENTITY:
  Input: "I'm John, I'm 23 years old"
  Extract: 
  - "User's name is John" (tag: name)
  - "User is 23 years old" (tag: age)
  Reasoning: These are separate concrete facts about the user's name and age.

  ✅ PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS:
  Input: "I'm 6'2 with brown hair and a muscular build"
  Extract:
  - "User is 6'2 tall" (tag: height)
  - "User has brown hair" (tag: hair_color)  
  - "User has a muscular build" (tag: body_type)
  Reasoning: These are separate concrete facts about the user's physical characteristics.

  ✅ OCCUPATION & EDUCATION:
  Input: "I work as a software engineer at a tech startup and graduated from UT Austin"
  Extract:
  - "User works as a software engineer" (tag: occupation)
  - "User graduated from UT Austin" (tag: education)
  Reasoning: These are separate concrete facts about the user's occupation and education.

  ✅ STABLE ROUTINES:
  Input: "I go to the bouldering gym 3 times per week"
  Extract:
  - "User goes to bouldering gym 3 times per week" (tag: routine)
  Reasoning: This is concrete information about the user's routine.

  ✅ RELATIONSHIP STATUS:
  Input: "I'm in a relationship with my girlfriend Sarah"
  Extract:
  - "User is in a relationship with his girlfriend Sarah" (tag: relationship_status)
  Reasoning: This is concrete information about the user's relationship status.

  EXAMPLES OF WHAT NOT TO EXTRACT:

  ❌ SUBJECTIVE FEELINGS:
  Input: "I feel like I choke during conversations"
  Extract: Empty array
  Reasoning: This is a feeling, not a stable fact

  ❌ TRANSIENT PERCEPTIONS:
  Input: "I think my jawline is too wide today"
  Extract: Empty array
  Reasoning: This is temporary self-perception

  ❌ ASPIRATIONS:
  Input: "I want to be a software engineer"
  Extract: Empty array
  Reasoning: This is an aspiration, not a concrete fact. Aspirations are not memories.

  ❌ CONSIDERATIONS:
  Input: "How to become a TCM doctor"
  Extract: Empty array
  Reasoning: This is a consideration, not an actual fact

  ❌ HYPOTHETICALS:
  Input: "Could I finish premed in 3 years and graduate without AP credits?"
  Extract: Empty array
  Reasoning: This is a hypothetical question about possibilities, not a statement of actual plans or enrollment.

  FOCUS: Stable, objective facts about who the user IS right now.

  OUTPUT: Only generalMemories array with personal facts.
